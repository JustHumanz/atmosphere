features:
  - Added a playbook to automatically generate all secrets for all roles for
    those which are not already defined.
upgrade:
  - When upgrading to this version, you'll need to make sure that you destroy
    your existing Molecule testing environment before convering again since
    it is now using automatically generated secrets instead of hard-coded
    secrets.  The secrets are stored inside the ``MOLECULE_EPHEMERAL_DIRECTORY``.
